    "text": "Work in progress\n\n\nInnovating democracy for the worse? The promises of citizen participation in Europe, PhD thesis\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n— Monograph, submission date in Sep. 2025 at LSE\nCitizens assemblies, participatory budgeting, or deliberative polls are democratic innovations: institutional procedures that should transform citizens participation in political decision making. These innovations, particularly those that bear on citizen deliberation, have been trialed by public organisations in many European countries, and attracted significant funding. The electoral success of authoritarian populism led to a wealth of scholarship on their promise to rejuvenate liberal democracy by means of institutional design. For many exponents of this paradigm, the question is how rather than if these innovations can contribute to counteracting the disenchantment with democracy in European societies – and democratising policy making on salient issues such as climate change.\nThrough a study of the EU, as an instructive case with broader implications, the thesis argues that this kind of institutional design may be innovating European democracy for the worse. It develops this argument on the basis of both normative analysis and political sociology. Whereas a first part examines the practical contradictions that challenge the normative coherence of democratic innovations, a second part argues that the paradigm can be understood as a symptom of rather than a transformative reaction to a broader disconnection between political institutions and society. The kinds of politics that are induced and foreshadowed by citizens assemblies and similar processes are likely to amplify the erosions of democracy that they are intended to counteract.\nThe thesis engages with debates in democratic theory in the spirit of non-ideal theory and argues that for the implementation of democratic innovations to be normatively coherent, their advocates must presume either of two things: The absence of certain features of European politics that democratic innovations are actually meant to address, such as the polarisation of political identities; or the existence of certain structural features of the European polity that democratic innovations are meant to advance in the first place, such as meaningful commu-nicative linkages between the domestic and European levels.\nTurning to why these innovations seem attractive to both political elites and European citizens nonetheless, I suggest that they fulfil functions different from those that their normative aims would envisage. For European institutions and elites, they can contribute to the self-legitimation of political and administrative authority in situations where democratic choice and control are constrained yet important for the self-description of these actors. For citizens, democratic innovations can act as a canvas for contradictory expectations vis-a-vis the political system – both domestically and at EU level. Some of these expectations appear to differ by societal groups; others seem to pertain to broader patterns regarding the role of expertise and popular sovereignty in contemporay politics. Along these lines, the thesis also contributes to scholarship on elites, debates in public opinion research, and EU studies.\nCombining comparative empirical research and democratic theory, the thesis develops its arguments from original evidence. To examine how different groups of citizens react to and form opinions on democratic innovations, I conduct vignette-based group interviews in several regions in Italy, Germany, and Ireland. Through the construction of a stratified sample of homogenous groups, we can explore differences associated with education, social class, and political orientation. A second empirical study examines the interactions and discourses of the political advocates and sponsors of democratic innovations in the EU. It combines multiple data sources (network data, public documents, and elite interviews) to develop a novel account of the emergence of the paradigm of democratic innovation in the Brussels complex.\nKeywords: European integration; democratic theory; legitimation; public opinion; democratic innovations\n\n\n\n\nThe many-public: Challenging the empirical legitimacy of deliberative innovations, Working paper, with Elena Pro\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\n— Paper accepted for presentation at MPSA Annual Conference 2025, Chicago, IL\nCitizens’ assemblies and other deliberative mini-publics (DMPs) are promoted as means to rejuvenate liberal democracy in the West. Advocates and scholars of DMPs maintain that these forms of direct citizen engagement are externally legitimate: their process is likely to find public acceptance, their outcomes to be perceived as fairer than those of mere representative institutions – not only amongst participants in the DMP itself. Based on the synthesis of different strands of empirical evidence and an original qualitative study, I challenge this proposition. I conduct 34 vignette-based group interviews in selected regions of three purposively sampled Western European countries (Germany, Ireland, and Italy) to understand how different social groups react to and form opinions on DMPs. Against this background, my study re-analyses observational and experimental evidence on public perceptions of DMPs to argue that it is implausible to interpret support for these processes and their outcomes as judgements of political legitimacy. As sponsored and designed forms of participation, DMPs can mean many yet contradictory things to different groups of citizens and in different political contexts. Extrapolated to real scenarios of political opinion formation and decision-making in Europe, the study’s results challenge the theoretical expectations of deliberative theory regarding the potential of DMPs to rejuvenate public confidence in the democratic process. The conclusion discusses avenues of further empirical research to test the studies’ arguments.\nKeywords: legitimacy, representation, mini-publics, public opinion, group interviews"

While such processes have usually been explained as efforts at institutional legitimation, participatory innovations in the EU prove theoretically puzzling: Their strategic and functional value for the Commission remains elusive. This paper develops an alternative theoretical proposition: Rather than legitimating the Commission to an external audience, participatory innovation functions as a simulation of democratic reform that addresses a need for self-legitimation. The analysis demonstrates that participatory innovation can provide the means of self-legitimation precisely because it does not realise democratic participation but enacts a performance of democratic reform. This performance should be understood as a simulation of reform that is both produced by the Commission with a field of advocates, experts, and participation professionals, and designed primarily for this same field of actors. In this way, the instrumental value of participatory innovation lies in how it justifies the work and authority of the Commission to itself. The theoretical proposition is grounded in an empirical study that draws on document analysis of institutional discourse, data on affiliations between actors in the field, and elite interviews.\nKeywords: legitimation; European Union; citizen engagement; democratic innovations; institutional reform; social theory"
