I am a PhD candidate at the London School of Economics and Political Science, working at the intersection of empirical political science and (normative) political theory. In my doctoral [research](research.qmd), I study the promises of novel and more direct forms of citizens participation in light of current sociopolitical challenges to democratic institutions in Europe. Focusing on the case of the EU, my project combines original, qualitative research, secondary survey analyses, and integration theory to assess the role of participatory and deliberative innovations – such as Citizens’ Assemblies – in the European Institutions. See [my CV](CV.qmd) for further details. I have [taught](teaching.qmd) seminars on these subjects at LSE, in Frankfurt and Hamburg. Besides, I am a mentor at the Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation. Please [get in touch](contact.qmd) about collaborations, ideas, and questions!
